A project based on R, to analyse medical records and transactions of over 6000 physicians (doctors) and their interactions (specifically interest in ownership) with different pharmaceutical companies. The business-focused aim of the project is to predict whether any incoming new physician will have any ownership interest in a particular company, after analysing the new physician's data.

An analysis of all the physicians, pharmaceutical firms and ownership stocks in these firms in the USA in 2018, to predict how interested physicians were in buying these ownership stocks of these firms.  
Trained the model with random forests with bagging and XG Boost to predict and improve accuracy.  
Part of the Analytics Cup contest present in the course. Scored a grade of 1.3 for the project on R and ranked amongst the top tier within 60 teams.
